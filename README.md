== Overview

I have a task (`theTask`) that conditionally generates a report on test results depending on the existence of other files.

I'm trying to write a plugin that appends this report (if it exists) to the list of packaged/artifacts.  The plugin compiles fine.  However clients of my plugin have corrupt ivy.xml files.  Half the time, the publications/artifact entries don't exist; half the time they don't.

== Steps to reproduce

* Build the plugin with `sbt publishLocal`
* Build the client with `sbt publishLocal`
* cat the ivy.xml file generated by the client.  Half the time the `publications` group is empty; half the time, it contains references to the client jar.
